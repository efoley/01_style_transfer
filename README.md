This project is just a Docker file and script for running Logan Engstrom's fast 
style transfer code.

The hard work is done by the style transfer code from <https://github.com/lengstrom/fast-style-transfer>. 
The docker image is based on Tensorflow's docker image.

To run, setup CUDA drivers and install nvidia-docker and eog. Then run `run.sh`.
